  <description summary="describe toplevel state">
    The purpose of this protocol is to describe the state of a foreign toplevel.

    This protocol depends on the ext-foreign-toplevel-list protocol.

    The compositor may choose to restrict this protocol to a special client
    launched by the compositor itself or expose it to all clients,
    this is compositor policy.

    The key words "must", "must not", "required", "shall", "shall not",
    "should", "should not", "recommended",  "may", and "optional" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in IETF RFC 2119.

    Warning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the testing
    phase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the
    corresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes can
    only be done by creating a new major version of the extension.

        The array contains 32-bit unsigned integers of host endianness that
        must be interpreted as ext_foreign_toplevel_handle_state_v1.state values.

        The toplevel has entered the output. Like wl_surface.enter, the toplevel

        The compositor must only send wl_output objects which the client has bound.
        The compositor must also send this event for every wl_output the client has
        bound. Clients can filter out wl_output objects which do not belong to the same
        event queue.

        If the ext_foreign_toplevel_handle_v1.finished event was received, then the
        compositor must not send this event.

        The toplevel has left the output. Like wl_surface.leave, the toplevel

        destroyed.

        The compositor must only send wl_output objects which the client has bound.
        The compositor must also send this event for every wl_output the client has

      <description summary="parent change">
        This event is emitted whenever the parent of the toplevel changes. A
        value of NULL means that there is no parent.

        The compositor must only send a ext_foreign_toplevel_handle_v1 object
        which was created using the same ext_foreign_toplevel_list object as
        the ext_foreign_toplevel_handle_v1 object this interface extends. No
        event is emitted when the parent handle is destroyed by the client.

        If the ext_foreign_toplevel_handle_v1.finished event was received, then the
        compositor must not send this event.

        The configured state must not be applied immediately. See
