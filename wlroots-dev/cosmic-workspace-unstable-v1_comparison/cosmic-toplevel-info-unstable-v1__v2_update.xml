    <description summary="list toplevels and properties thereof">
      The purpose of this protocol is to enable clients such as taskbars
      or docks to access a list of opened applications and basic properties
      thereof.

      It thus extends ext_foreign_toplevel_v1 to provide more information
      and actions on foreign toplevels.

      <description summary="a toplevel has been created">
        This event is never emitted for clients binding version 2
        of this protocol, they should use `get_cosmic_toplevel` instead.

        This event is emitted for clients binding version 1 whenever a
        new toplevel window is created. It is emitted for all toplevels,
        regardless of the app that has created them.

        All initial properties of the toplevel (title, app_id, states, etc.)
        will be sent immediately after this event via the corresponding
        events in zcosmic_toplevel_handle_v1.

        This request indicates that the client no longer wishes to receive

        toplevel_created events until the finished event is emitted.

        The client must not send any more requests after this one.

        Note: This request isn't necessary for clients binding version 2
        of this protocol and will be ignored.

        This event indicates that the compositor is done sending events

        object immediately after sending this request, so it will become
        invalid and the client should free any resources associated with it.

        Note: This event is emitted immediately after calling `stop` for
        clients binding version 2 of this protocol for backwards compatibility.

      A zcosmic_toplevel_handle_v1 object represents an open toplevel
